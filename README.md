# Welcome to TryWithKids

## What is this program about
This is a fairly simple program to browse, add, edit, search and delete scientific 
experiments with kids. It will have separate GUIs for maintenance that can do all
the above-mentioned things (f.ex. for parents or teachers), and for users, that 
can just browse and search for experiments (f.ex. for children or parents if someone 
else can add experiments for them).
Some experiments come with the software.
There will be a way to log into the program (not there yet).
The database-solution is MongoDB. 

## Environment
This program has been written with Netbeans version 8.2. and java version 1.8.0_181. 
Mongo java-driver version is 3.10.1 and Morphia version is 1.4.0. 
MongoDB is 4.0 Community edition.
The computer operating system used is MacOS Mojave.

## Development 

### Iteration 1:
Currently the GUI works for add and browse all.

No separation of user profiles yet.
Four experiments come with the software at this time.
